As stated in [ComputerWorld, September 29,1986](https://books.google.com/books?id=2z5elvZrpisC&pg=PA57&lpg=PA57&dq=computerworld+w+w+d+dowdell&ots=eNy77m-M-V&sig=ACfU3U0QHAY0LN9gMdKvPcuQiT3ExJYsfQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwizjuTh7JrvAhWuGFkFHba-BNwQ6AEwAHoECAEQAw#v=onepage&q=computerworld%20w%20w%20d%20dowdell&f=true)
- Professional: those who make a living from designing and writing computer software require different tools than end users who develop software for their own, or for limited use.
- Nonprofessional: those who does not have the time or need to become a computer expert but is primarily interested in achieving a desired result as quickly and easily as possible.

I categorized myself as a **nonprofessional**.
